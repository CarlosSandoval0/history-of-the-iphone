I've created a website that displays Apple iphones and demonstrates the changes throughout generations. It shows the release date, storage sizes, and the pricing options available at time of launch. In CSS i've created flex containers and set the display property to flex. Followed by a flex wrap declared to wrap. I added a justify content property set to space around for tablets and space evenly on larger screens.
In Javascript the on mouse over event triggers the functions in charge of changing the price and text color once a user moves their mouse over a gb size. If the mouse is away from a gb size the pricing will be set to starting price. 
A mixture of variables and pseudo elements work together to make CSS animations, letting the user know when they are hovering over a gb size.
